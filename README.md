Spam Detection Model
====================

This project implements a **Spam Detection Model** that classifies messages as spam or not spam. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and uses the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** for text preprocessing and feature extraction.

Project Overview
----------------

The goal of this project is to build a spam detection model that identifies spam messages in text data. By using natural language processing techniques and machine learning, the model learns to classify messages based on patterns in word usage, frequency, and other linguistic features.

Features
--------

-   **Preprocessing and Cleaning**: Text data is cleaned and normalized, including tasks like removing stop words, tokenization, and stemming.
-   **Feature Extraction**: Transforming cleaned text data into numerical features for model training.
-   **Model Training and Prediction**: Training a machine learning model on the processed data to detect spam messages.
-   **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate model performance.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   **Python**: Core programming language
-   **NLTK**: Used for text preprocessing and NLP tasks
-   **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation
-   **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical operations

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this repository:

    bash

    Copy code

    `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detection-model.git`

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    bash

    Copy code

    `cd spam-detection-model`

3.  Install required packages:

    bash

    Copy code

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    > **Note**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Usage
-----

1.  Prepare your dataset (e.g., a CSV file with labeled text messages).
2.  Preprocess the text data using NLTK's NLP tools.
3.  Train the model on labeled data.
4.  Evaluate the model on a test set to ensure it performs well on unseen data.
5.  Predict whether new messages are spam or not using the trained model.

Run the main script as follows:

bash

Copy code

`python main.py`

Model Evaluation
----------------

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

-   **Accuracy**: The percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions.
-   **Precision and Recall**: To measure the model's ability to correctly classify spam and avoid false positives.
-   **F1-Score**: A balanced metric that considers both precision and recall.
